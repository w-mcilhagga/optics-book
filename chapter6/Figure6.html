      <span class='figno'>Figure 6.</span> A lens can only focus at one distance at a time. This lens is looking at three different coloured point objects at different distances. Initially the screen is set to focus on the nearest (orange) object, but in that case, the images of the other two are blurred. If you move the screen to focus on the middle (white) object, it blurs the orange one. Only one distance can be in focus at a time.</span>
