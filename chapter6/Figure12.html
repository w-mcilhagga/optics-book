      <span class='figno'>Figure 12.</span> Chromatic aberration from a thin lens. The refractive index varies with wavelength, causing each wavelength to come to a focus at a different distance. Here only three wavelengths are represented, coloured blue, green and red. Blue comes into focus first, then green, then red last. The image is a mixture of the blur discs of these three wavelengths. In reality, with more wavelengths, the blur would look like concentric rainbows.</span></p>
	  <p>You can turn off some of the wavelengths using the checkboxes to see what happens to the wavelengths individually. </p>
