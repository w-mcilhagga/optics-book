      <span class='figno'>Figure 1.</span> A point object sends divergent light into a lens which converges it. If a screen (grey vertical line) is placed where all the rays converge, the image is a sharp point, as shown in the black inset to the right. If the screen is moved anywhere else, however, the image becomes blurred in the shape of a disc. It also dims, as the same amount of light from the point object is spread over a larger area.</span>
