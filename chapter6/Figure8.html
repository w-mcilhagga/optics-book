      <span class="figno">Figure 8.</span> Using the ray-tracing rules to decide where a negative lens forms a sharp image of a point on an object. The three rules can be turned on and off using the check boxes in the lower left corner. The white circles show the focal points of the lens. The object is a white arrow and the image is a bluish arrow. </p>
	  <p>The image is formed at the intersection of virtual rays. To see these virtual rays, you must click the check-box in the lower right corner. Also, the image only appears when two or more rules are on, because the image is located where two virtual rays <b>intersect</b>. (The virtual ray for Rule 3 overlaps the actual ray.)</p>
