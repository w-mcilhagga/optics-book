      <span class="figno">Figure 4.</span> The top diagram shows the far point of a hyperope. When convergent light (with the right amount of convergence) hits the hyperopic eye, the eye converges it more, and it then forms a sharp image on the retina. If the eye were not there, the convergent light would instead converge to a point some distance behind the retina (dashed lines), called the far point.</p>
	  <p>In the bottom diagram, parallel light from a distant object is converged by a positive lens towards the focal point of the lens, which in this case is \(0.09\text{m}\) from the lens. When the lens is moved so that its focal point coincides with the far point, the convergence of the light, when it hits the eye, is exactly what the eye needs for clear vision.
