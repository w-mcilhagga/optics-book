<h1 id="whatlensesdo">What Lenses Do</h1>

<p>Light is made up of particles called photons, which travel in straight lines called <strong>rays</strong> until they hit an object. When photons hit transparent objects, they change direction as they enter or leave the object (refraction). When photons hit other objects, they are either absorbed by the object or they bounce off it (reflection). If the object isn’t shiny, the photons can bounce off in any direction. This is called diffuse reflection. These diffusely reflected rays spread out, or <strong>diverge</strong> (<a href="#Figure1">Figure 1(a)</a>).</p>

<p>The reflected rays carry information about the objects they reflect from. However, in <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1(b)</a>, if we try to capture and use the light reflecting off the apple, by putting in a flat screen to absorb the light, we only get an overall measure of how much reflected light there is. We can&#8217;t tell exactly where the light is coming from, so we can&#8217;t work out what the object is, or its shape, or even where it is.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1(a).</strong> A light source at the top of the picture sends out many rays of light. Two of them are shown striking an object. Each of the rays coming from the light source consists of many photons, and when they hit the object, they reflect off in random directions to form fans of diverging rays.</p>

<p>The reflected light can tell us something about what is in front of us. Click the right hand arrow to see.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1(b).</strong> On the right, the reflected light is being caught by a screen (shown as a grey line). The light hitting the screen tells us that there <em>is</em> something in front of us reflecting light, but not what or where it is, because light from different points on the object is all smeared together on the screen.</p>

<p>For example, the points A and B on the screen both catch light from the top and bottom points on the object, so we can&#8217;t separate the light from the top or bottom of the object.</p>

</figcaption>

<span style='display:none'>

<figcaption>

<p><strong>Figure 1(c).</strong> An opaque barrier with a tiny hole (called a pinhole) is placed between the object and the screen. The hole is so small that only one ray from each point in the object is allowed through.</p>

<p>Now the light hitting point A comes from one direction, and the light hitting point B comes from a different direction, so we now know something about where the light is coming from. This is an <strong>image</strong>. The problem here is that the pinhole has blocked most of the light, so the image is quite dim.</p>

</figcaption></span>

<span style='display:none'>
<img src="media/figure1d.svg" />

<figcaption>

<p><strong>Figure 1(d).</strong> A <strong>lens</strong> catches the divergent light coming from a point on an object and converges it onto a point. It does this for all the points on the object. The light converging on point A or point B all comes from the same place, so again we know where the light is coming from on the screen. This image is much brighter than the pinhole image, because each point (A or B) receives many rays of light.</p>

</figcaption>

</span>

</span>

</figure>

<p>To make sense of the world, we don&#8217;t just need the total amount of reflected light, we also need to know where it is coming from. One way to do this is to use a “pinhole”, which is an opaque barrier with a tiny (i.e. pin-sized) hole in it. The hole is so small that effectively only one ray of light coming from any point on the object can get through it. When a ray of light then hits a screen (<a href="#Figure1">Figure 1(c)</a>) we not only know how much light is being reflected, but from where, since only light coming through the pinhole in a certain direction can hit the screen at that point. This is an <strong>image</strong>: a pattern of light on a flat screen, where we know which direction the light is coming from at all points in the pattern. (Notice that the image from a pinhole is flipped upside down, andwill also be flipped left to right.)</p>

<p>The drawback with pinholes is that very little light gets through the hole, so the image is typically very dim. If we could gather all the light rays diverging from a single point, and converge them back to a point, we could make the image much brighter. This is in fact what a <strong>lens</strong> does (<a href="#Figure1">Figure 1(d)</a>). Because a lens captures a lot of rays, each point on the image is brighter than with the pinhole and the lens image, made from all these points, is brighter too. Just like a pinhole image, the lens image is also flipped upside down and left-to-right.</p>

<p>This, then, is what lenses do: they create images by capturing divergent light from all points on an object, and converging them to different points on a flat screen. To describe exactly how lenses work, we first need to get more precise about what is meant by converging light and diverging light. That&#8217;s what we will deal with next.</p>

<h2 id="convergence">Convergence</h2>

<p>Converging light is light that is coming together, eventually to a single point, like the light leaving the lens in <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1(d)</a>. You would expect a very convergent bundle of rays to come together quickly, while a less convergent bundle of rays should take longer to come together (see <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2(a) and (b)</a>).</p>

<figure id='Figure2'>
<span class='slideshow-container'>
<span>
<img src='media/figure2a.svg' >
<figcaption>

<p><strong>Figure 2(a)</strong>. A bundle of rays leaving a lens with high convergence will come to a point quickly, so the distance from the lens to the point where all the rays converge is small.</p>

<span>
<img src='media/figure2b.svg' >

<figcaption>

<p><strong>Figure 2(b)</strong>. A bundle of rays leaving a lens with low convergence will come to a point slowly, so the distance from the lens to the point where all the rays converge is large.</p>

</figcaption></span>
</span>
</span>
</figure>

<p>Intuitively, then, convergence is inversely related to the distance it takes the rays to come together to a point: <strong>more</strong> convergence means <strong>less</strong> distance.</p>

<p>Let’s mathematically define the convergence of light leaving a lens as</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\text{convergence} = \frac{1}{\text{distance from lens to point of convergence}}\tag{1}\]</span></p>

<p>Since the point where the light converges is often where the image forms (as in <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1(d)</a>), we can also think of convergence as</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\text{convergence} = \frac{1}{\text{distance from lens to image}}\tag{2}\]</span></p>

<p>In almost all optical calculations, distances are measured in <strong>metres</strong>. The units of convergence are dioptres (abbreviated <span class="math">\(\text{D}\)</span>, or equivalently <span class="math">\(m^{-1}\)</span>). For example, if a bundle of rays leaving a lens converges to a point which is <span class="math">\(0.5\text{m}\)</span> away from the lens, then the convergence of the light when it leaves the lens is, according to Equation (1), <span class="math">\(1/0.5 = 2\)</span> dioptres, or <span class="math">\(2\text{D}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Equation (1) can be rearranged as:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\text{distance from lens to the image} = \frac{1}{\text{convergence}}\tag{3}\]</span></p>

<p>Using this formula, if we know that a bundle of light rays leaving a lens has a convergence of say <span class="math">\(5\text{D}\)</span>, then they will converge to a point that is <span class="math">\(1/5 = 0.2\)</span> metres away from the lens. If the light leaving the lens has a convergence of <span class="math">\(10\text{D}\)</span>, it will converge to a point that is <span class="math">\(1/10 = 0.1\)</span> metres from the lens. And so on.</p>

<p>So if we know the convergence of the light leaving the lens, we can work out where the image appears: it’s where all the bundles of converging light narrow down to a point. The convergence of the light leaving the lens depends on two things: the divergence of the light entering the lens, and the converging ability of the lens itself. We’ll look at these next.</p>

<h2 id="divergence">Divergence</h2>

<p>Light rays <strong>diverge</strong>, by definition, if they are spreading apart. The divergence of a bundle of rays, when they hit a lens, is related to how fast they are spreading apart when they hit it. <a href="#Figure3">Figure 3(a) and (b)</a> shows a bundle of rays diverging from a point and hitting a lens.</p>

<figure id='Figure3'>
<span class='slideshow-container'>

<p><strong>Figure 3(b)</strong>. A bundle of divergent rays starting a lomng way from a lens will have low convergence when they finally strike it.</p>

</figcaption></span>
</span>
</span>
</figure>

<p>Highly divergent rays come from a point which is quite close to the lens, and less divergent rays come from a point which is further away. So, like convergence, there is an inverse relationship between distance and divergence: <strong>more</strong> divergence means <strong>less</strong> distance.</p>

<p>Let’s define the divergence of a bundle of light rays coming from a point on an object, when it hits a lens, as</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\text{divergence} = \frac{1}{\text{distance from lens to the object}}\tag{4}\]</span></p>

<p>As before, the distance is measured in metres and the divergence is in dioptres. However, divergence is in some sense the opposite of convergence, so we need some way of showing this. In optics, we do this by making divergence a negative number.</p>

<p>For example, suppose a bundle of rays is diverging from an object which is <span class="math">\(125\text{mm}\)</span> (or <span class="math">\(0.125\text{m}\)</span>) away from a lens. Using Equation (4), the divergence of the light when it hits the lens is <span class="math">\(1/0.125 = 8\text{D}\)</span>. Because divergence is negative, we stick a minus sign in front of it, to get <span class="math">\(-8\text{D}\)</span>. Any time you see negative dioptres, you know you’re dealing with divergent light.</p>

<p>Just like convergence, the divergence Equation (4) can be rearranged as</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\text{distance from lens to the object} = \frac{1}{\text{divergence}}\tag{5}\]</span></p>

<p>For example, suppose some light has a divergence of <span class="math">\(-4\text{D}\)</span> when it hits a lens. The formula says that the distance from the lens to the object is then <span class="math">\(1/(-4) = -0.25\text{m}\)</span>. That is, the distance from the lens to the object is <strong>negative</strong>. What could that mean?</p>

<h3 id="thesignconvention">The Sign Convention</h3>

<p>A negative distance is an example of what is called the <strong>sign convention</strong>, summarized in <a href="#Figure4">Figure 4</a>. In optical calculations, some distances are deemed to be positive and some are negative. The sign convention can be set down in a few rules:</p>

<figure id="Figure4">
<span class='slideshow-container'>
<span>
<img src="media/signconv.svg" />

<figcaption>

<p><strong>Figure 4.</strong> The sign convention. Light travels from the object through the lens to the image. This is <strong>left-to-right</strong>. The direction going from lens to object is opposite the direction of light (i.e. is rightwards), so it is a negative (-) distance. The direction going from lens to image is the same as the direction of light (i.e. is leftwards), so it is a positive (+) distance.</p>

<p>Click to see the sign convention for light travelling from left-to-right.</p>

</figcaption>
</span>
</span>
</figure>

<ul>
<li><p>All distances are measured from the lens we are working with.</p></li>
<li><p>Each measured distance has a direction, which is the direction you&#8217;d have to travel to go from the lens to your destination. In <a href="#Figure4">Figure 4</a>, the distance from the lens to the apple is left, because if we started at the lens, we’d have to move left to get to the apple. The distance from the lens to the image screen is right, because if we started at the lens, we’d have to move right to get to the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>A distance whose direction is the <strong>same</strong> as the direction of the light is positive. In <a href="#Figure4">Figure 4</a>, the distance to the image is the same direction as the direction of the light, so it’s positive.</p></li>
<li><p>A distance whose direction is the <strong>opposite</strong> of the direction of the light is negative. In <a href="#Figure4">Figure 4</a>, the distance to the apple is opposite the direction of the light (rightward), so it’s negative.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The sign convention is slightly tricky, but it gets easier with practice. (Also, to be fair, there are a few times that it&#8217;s best to just outright ignore it, but we&#8217;ll get to those.)</p>

<p>The benefit of the sign convention is that we don’t need separate definitions for divergence or convergence any more; we only need one definition, which we will call <strong>vergence</strong> :</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\text{vergence} = \frac{1}{\text{distance from lens to the object or image}}\tag{6}\]</span></p>

<p>The sign of the vergence tells you whether the light is converging or diverging: negative vergence means diverging light, and positive vergence means converging light.</p>

<p>If we know the convergence or divergence of the light hitting or leaving the lens, we can work out the distance to the image or object by</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\text{distance from lens to the image or object} = \frac{1}{\text{vergence}}\tag{7}\]</span></p>

<p>The distance may be either positive or negative, and that tells us which direction we should travel, starting from the lens, to find the object or the image. If it’s a positive distance, we travel in the same direction as the light, and if it’s a negative distance, opposite the direction of the light.</p>

<h2 id="thethinlensequation.">The Thin Lens Equation.</h2>

<p><a href="#Figure5">Figure 5</a> shows a lens forming a sharp image of a single point object, like one of the bundles of rays in <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1(d)</a>. Light diverges from a point and hits the lens. The lens changes this to convergent light, and this converges to a single point, which is the image. In <a href="#Figure5">Figure 5</a>, the object is <span class="math">\(1\text{m}\)</span> away from the lens, to the left; and the light converges to a point <span class="math">\(0.33\text{m}\)</span> away from the lens, to the right. Usually, the object and image are composed of many points, as in <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1(d)</a>, but if we can work out what happens to one point, we can work out what happens to all of them.</p>

<figure id="Figure5">
<div id = 'Figure5 image' class='canvas-div'></div>
<figcaption>

<p><strong>Figure 5.</strong> The object is <span class="math">\(1\text{m}\)</span> to the left of the lens, and the image forms <span class="math">\(0.333\text{m}\)</span> to the right of the lens. The lens is drawn as a double-headed arrow, which is a standard symbol for a converging lens. Small arrowheads on the light rays show the direction the light is travelling.</p>

<p>You can grab and move the light to different distances and see what image distance occurs. Note that if you get the object too close to the lens, the image distance gets very large, until at some point the light leaving the lens doesn&#8217;t converge any more.</p>

<p>What happens to the image position when the object moves away from the lens? What happens to the image when the object moves towards the lens?</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><script src='scripts/drawovallens.js'></script>
<script src='scripts/Figure5.js'></script></p>

<p>Let’s work out the vergences of the light entering and leaving the lens. The light in the diagram is travelling rightward. The object is left of the lens, which is opposite the direction of light, so (from the sign convention) the distance is negative. Thus, the distance from lens to object is <span class="math">\(-1\text{m}\)</span>, and the vergence of the light when it hits the lens is <span class="math">\(1/(-1) = -1\text{D}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The image is to the right of the lens, so it is a positive distance. The light leaving the lens converges <span class="math">\(0.333\text{m}\)</span> away from the lens, so the vergence of the light as it leaves the lens must be <span class="math">\(1/0.333 = 3\text{D}\)</span>.</p>

<p>What happened to the vergence of the light as it passed through the lens? It hit the lens with a vergence of <span class="math">\(-1\text{D}\)</span> and left the lens with a vergence of <span class="math">\(3\text{D}\)</span>. So the lens had the effect of adding <span class="math">\(4\text{D}\)</span> of convergence to the light (because <span class="math">\(-1+4=3\)</span>).</p>

<p>Because <a href="#Figure5">Figure 5</a> is interactive, you can try a few other distances. Here are some in a table, with calculations:</p>

<table id='Table1'>
<tr style='text-align:left'>

<p>The last column (the change in vergence as the light goes through the lens) is always close to <span class="math">\(4\text{D}\)</span> and, if it wasn&#8217;t for rounding, would be exactly <span class="math">\(4\text{D}\)</span>. So this lens always adds <span class="math">\(4\text{D}\)</span> of convergence to the light as it passes through it.</p>

<p>This is all that lenses do: they change the vergence of the light by a fixed amount, called the <strong>power</strong>, of the lens. The lens in <a href="#Figure5">Figure 5</a> has a power of <span class="math">\(4\text{D}\)</span>, because it always changed the vergence of the light passing through it by that amount. (Note that when we write down positive focal powers, we normally put a plus sign in front of them, so the power of this lens is written as <span class="math">\(+4\text{D}\)</span>).</p>

<p>When the object gets too close to the lens, the vergence of the light entering the lens is greater than its power. In this case, the light leaving the lens is still divergent, and so does not converge on an image. An example is in this table:</p>

<table id='Table1'>

<p>The vergence leaving the lens can&#8217;t be worked out from the distance to the image, because there is no image. Instead, the value of <span class="math">\(-1.18\text{D}\)</span> in the fourth column comes from the fact that the lens always adds its power (which for this lens is <span class="math">\(4\text{D}\)</span>) to the vergence entering it.</p>

<h3 id="theequationitself.">The Equation Itself.</h3>

<p>All this can be summarized in a simple equation called the <strong>thin lens equation</strong>:<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="math">\[(\text{vergence hitting lens}) + (\text{lens power}) =(\text{vergence leaving lens})\]</span></p>

<p>This can be abbreviated to save writing so much. The abbreviation we’ll use is</p>

<p><span class="math">\[V_{in} + F = V_{out}\tag{8}\]</span></p>

<p>In this equation, <span class="math">\(V_{in}\)</span> means the Vergence of the light going <strong>in</strong> to, or hitting, the lens. Typically, <span class="math">\(V_{in}\)</span> is equal to <span class="math">\(1/\text{(distance from lens to object)}\)</span>. <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is the Focal power of the lens.</p>

<p><span class="math">\(V_{out}\)</span> means the Vergence of the light coming <strong>out</strong> of, or leaving, the lens. <span class="math">\(V_{out}\)</span> is the same as <span class="math">\(1/\text{(distance from lens to image)}\)</span>, because the light leaving the lens typically converges to form an image. That means that the image forms at a distance of <span class="math">\(1/V_{out}\)</span>, as per Equation (7).</p>

<p>Almost all optics involving lenses can be analyzed and understood using the thin lens equation, so it’s really, really important.</p>

<h2 id="basicopticalcalculations.">Basic Optical Calculations.</h2>

<p>The main use of the thin lens equation is for calculations involving image and object distances. The best way to see how to use the thin lens equation is to look at a few examples:</p>

<h3 id="example1">Example 1</h3>

<p>An object is placed <span class="math">\(75\text{cm}\)</span> to the left of a lens which has a focal power of <span class="math">\(+8\text{D}\)</span>. Where does the image form?</p>

<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Until you get good at these calculations (and often even then) it is a good idea to start with a sketch to makes it clear where everything is, and what sign the distances are. This is the sketch I drew for this example:</p>

<figure>
<img src="media/diagram1.jpg" alt="Sketch for example 1" />
<figcaption>Sketch for example 1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The sketch includes arrows on the rays of light to show which direction they are travelling and arrows at the end of every distance to show which direction you travel when you’re measuring the distance. (Note that the distance has been changed to metres, which you have to do in optical calculations.) It also includes the direction of the light at the top. In other respects, it looks a lot like Figure 5](#Figure5).</p></li>
<li><p>Next, we need to work out whether the object distance is positive or negative. The light is travelling to the right in the sketch. The object is to the left of the lens. That’s opposite the light direction, so it’s a negative distance, <span class="math">\(-0.75\text{m}\)</span> (remember, all distances should be in metres).</p></li>
<li><p>Next we have to work out the vergence of the light from the object. The vergence <span class="math">\(V_{in}\)</span> of the light entering the lens is one over the distance to the object: <span class="math">\(V_{in} = 1/(-0.75) = - 1.33\text{D}\)</span> (rounded to two decimal places).</p></li>
<li><p>The focal power of the lens is <span class="math">\(F=+8\text{D}\)</span>, so the vergence of the light leaving the lens is <span class="math">\(V_{out}=V_{in} + F = -1.33 + 8 = +6.67\text{D}\)</span>, according to the thin lens equation. This is positive so the light leaving the lens is converging.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we convert the vergence <span class="math">\(V_{out}\)</span> into a distance. The distance to the image is one over the vergence, so the light converges to a point which is <span class="math">\(1/6.67 = 0.15\text{m}\)</span> from the lens. Because it is a positive distance, the point of convergence (and hence the image) is to the right of the lens.</p></li>
<li><p>Our conclusion: the image forms <span class="math">\(0.15\text{m}\)</span> to the right of the lens.</p></li>

<p>Here, the rays leave the lens and converge to a point, where the image is. I haven&#8217;t drawn the rays enetring the lens because I don&#8217;t yet know where they come from.</p></li>
<li><p>The distance to the image is positive because it’s to the right of the lens (same direction as the light). Thus the vergence of the light leaving the lens <span class="math">\(V_{out}\)</span> must be <span class="math">\(1/0.55 = 1.82\text{D}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The thin lens equation is <span class="math">\(V_{in} + F = V_{out}\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is <span class="math">\(+5\text{D}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V_{out}=1.82\text{D}\)</span>, the equation becomes <span class="math">\(V_{in}+5=1.82\)</span>. Solve this equation by subtracting <span class="math">\(5\)</span> from both sides to get <span class="math">\(V_{in} = -3.18\text{D}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The distance to the object is <span class="math">\(1/V_{in}\)</span>, so the object is at <span class="math">\(1/(-3.18) = -0.314\)</span> metres from the lens. A negative distance means the object is to the left of the lens.</p></li>

<p>This time, the light is travelling leftwards from the object through the lens to the image. The object is to the right of the lens, which is opposite the direction of the light, so it’s a negative distance (again). The image is to the left of the lens, so it’s a positive distance.</p></li>
<li><p>The vergence entering the lens is one over the distance to the object, <span class="math">\(V_{in}=1/(-0.75)=-1.33\text{D}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The vergence leaving the lens is one over the distance to the image, <span class="math">\(V_{out}=1/0.25=4\text{D}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The thin lens equation is <span class="math">\(V_{in}+F=V_{out}\)</span>. Substituting in the values we know gives us <span class="math">\(-1.33+F=4\)</span>. Adding 1.33 to both sides gives <span class="math">\(F=+5.33\text{D}\)</span>, which is the answer.</p></li>

<p>Note that vergences have been rounded to 2 decimal places here, but full accuracy has been used in the calculations.</p>

<h2 id="thefocallength">The Focal Length</h2>

<p>So far, our main concern has been with light that is convergent or divergent. However, some interesting things happen when light is neither. A bundle of light rays that is neither divergent nor convergent has rays which aren’t spreading apart or coming together. The only way that can happen is if the rays of light are parallel.</p>

<p>Why? Because parallel rays aren’t diverging, so their vergence can’t be negative. Because parallel rays are not converging, their vergence can’t be positive either. The only number that isn&#8217;t positive and isn&#8217;t negative is zero. So parallel light has zero vergence.</p>

<p>Light coming from distant objects is <strong>almost</strong> parallel. For example, the horizon is about <span class="math">\(5000\text{m}\)</span> away. Light from the horizon entering a lens has a divergence of <span class="math">\(V_{in}=1/(-5000) = -0.002\text{D}\)</span>. That’s pretty close to zero (although still negative). The sun is about 150 billion metres away from us, so sunlight entering a lens on earth has a vergence of about <span class="math">\(V_{in}=1/(-150,000,000,000)=-0.000000000007\text{D}\)</span>. That’s very very <strong>very</strong> close to zero.</p>

<p>What happens when parallel light (say from a distant object) enters a lens, as in <a href="#Figure6">Figure 6</a>? For a start, <span class="math">\(V_{in}=0\)</span>, because the light is parallel. Putting this value into the thin lens equation <span class="math">\(V_{in}+F=V_{out}\)</span> gives us simply <span class="math">\(F=V_{out}\)</span>. So when parallel light enters a lens, the vergence of light leaving the lens is exactly equal to the lens power.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 6(a).</strong> When the object is very far away, rays of light entering the lens are parallel, with a vergence <span class="math">\(V_{in}\)</span> equal to zero. In this case, the distance to the image is called the Focal Length, and light converges on a focal point. The power of the lens is <span class="math">\(10\text{D}\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(V_{out}=10\)</span>, and the distance to the image is <span class="math">\(1/10 = 0.1\text{m}\)</span>.

<p>The distance from the lens to the image is, as usual, <span class="math">\(1/V_{out}\)</span>, but since <span class="math">\(F=V_{out}\)</span> in this case, the distance can also be written as <span class="math">\(1/F\)</span>. This distance <span class="math">\(1/F\)</span> is called the <strong>Focal Length</strong>, because it is closely related to the Focal Power <span class="math">\(F\)</span>. If you need it, the usual symbol for focal length is <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, and so <span class="math">\(f=1/F\)</span>, and vice versa, <span class="math">\(F=1/f\)</span>. The point where the rays in <a href="#Figure6">Figure 6</a> converge is called the <strong>Focal Point</strong>.</p>

<p>What about the case when parallel light <em>leaves</em> a lens, as shown in <a href="#Figure7">Figure 7</a>? This means that <span class="math">\(V_{out}\)</span> is zero, and the thin lens equation simplifies to <span class="math">\(V_{in}+F=0\)</span>, which rearranges to become <span class="math">\(V_{in}=-F\)</span>. Thus, when parallel light leaves a lens, the vergence of light entering the lens is exactly opposite to the lens power.</p>

<p>The distance from the lens to the object is <span class="math">\(1/V_{in}\)</span>, but since <span class="math">\(V_{in}=-F\)</span> in this case, the distance can also be written as <span class="math">\(1/(-F)\)</span>. This is another focal length, but this time in the opposite direction (<a href="#Figure7">Figure 7</a>). The point where the object is in <a href="#Figure7">Figure 7</a> is another focal point.</p>

<p>When there might be any confusion, we distinguish these two focal points by giving them different names. The focal point shown in <a href="#Figure6">Figure 6</a> will be called the <strong>Image</strong> Focal Point, because it’s where an image forms<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> when parallel light enters the lens. The focal point shown in <a href="#Figure7">Figure 7</a> will be called the <strong>Object</strong> Focal Point<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a> because it&#8217;s where you need to put an object to get paralle light leaving a lens.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 7.</strong> When the object is placed so that light leaving the lens is in parallel, the distance to the object is another focal length. The focal point is marked as a yellow dot, and the focal length is given in yellow.</p>

<p>You can use the slider to change the focal length of the lens. Then, if you grab the light source, you can drag it onto the new focal point and confirm that you get parallel light.</p>

<p>When the object is at the focal point, <span class="math">\(V_{out}=0\)</span>. What can you say about <span class="math">\(V_{out}\)</span> when the object is further away than the focal point? What can you say about <span class="math">\(V_{out}\)</span> when the object is closer to the lens than the focal point?</p>
