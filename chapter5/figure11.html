      <span class='figno'>Figure 11.</span> Chromatic aberration from a thin lens. The refractive index varies with wavelength, causing each wavelength to come to a focus at a different distance. Here only three wavelengths are represented, coloured blue, green and red. Blue comes into focus first, then green, then red last. The image is a mixture of the blur discs of these three wavelengths. In reality, with more wavelengths, the blur would look like concentric rainbows.</span>
