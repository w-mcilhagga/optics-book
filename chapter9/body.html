  <h1 id="myopia">Myopia</h1>
  
  <p>Normally, the eye forms sharp images of distant objects on the retina without accommodation. This normal state of affairs is called <em>emmetropia</em> (meaning well-proportioned sight). Optically, this means that when parallel light hits the cornea, the convergence of the light leaving the back of the lens is exactly one over the distance from the lens to the retina, so that it converges to a point precisely on the retina.</p>
  
  <p>Not all eyes are normal, however. In European countries, about 20-30% of people cannot see distant objects clearly, but they can see closer objects without accommodating. These people have <em>myopia</em>, meaning short-sightedness. Optically, myopia occurs because the sharp image of a distant object forms slightly in front of the retina. By the time the light hits the retina, it has spread out somewhat, and so the image formed on the retina is blurred.</p>
  
  <p>For myopes, then, when parallel light from a distant object hits the cornea, the convergence of the light leaving the back of the lens is too high, so the light converges to a point too soon. One way this can happen is if some component of the eye's optics has too much power. For example, the cornea may be slightly more curved than normal. This kind of myopia is called <em>refractive</em> myopia.</p>
  
  <p>The other way an eye can be myopic is if it is too long. Then the retina is further away from the lens than it should be. The vergence of the light leaving the eye is enough to converge the light to where the retina <em>should</em> be, but the retina is actually a little further away. Although the eye's optics in this case are normal, they are too powerful for a longer eye, and so a sharp image forms in front of the retina. This is called <em>axial</em> myopia, because the eye's optic axis is longer than it should be. This is the most common form of myopia. </p>

    <figcaption>
      <span class="figno">Figure 1.</span> Two kinds of myopia. The eye on the left is longer than normal, but has normal power. Parallel rays of light from a distant object converge where the normally placed retina should be (dashed curve). With nothing to stop them there, they continue and form a blurred spot on the further-away retina. The eye on the right has greater optical power than normal, but a normal length. The greater power means parallel rays of light from a distant object are converged too much and again form an image in front of the retina.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2 id="blur">Myopic Blur</h2>

  <p>The main optical consequence of myopia is blur. If a sharp image of a distant object always forms in front of the retina of the myopic eye, by the time the light reaches the eye it has spread out again, and the image is no longer sharp. The amount of blur produced by myopia can be calculated using the blur equation introduced in Chapter 5</p>

  <div>
    \[\theta_{blur}=57 a |V_{need}-V_{out}|\]
  </div>

  <p>In this formula, the difference \(|V_{need}-V_{out}|\) is the mismatch between the power of the eye&#39;s optics \(V_{out}\) and the power needed to form a sharp image \(V_{need}\). In myopia, \(V_{out}&gt;V_{need}\). The aperture \(a\) in the formula is the pupil diameter, in metres. So the amount of blur experienced by a myope is directly proportional to the myopic error, and to the pupil size.</p>

  <p>This is exploited in the Snellen and Bailie-Lovie eye charts. By seeing what size of letter is blurred beyond recognition we can estimate the size of the blur circle \(\theta_{blur}\), and from that the amount of refractive error. Of course, to do this, we have to measure or control the pupil diameter \(a\), since that affects the amount of blur.</p>

  <p>Anther consequence of the blur equation is that blur worsens when the pupil diameter \(a\) increases. Since the pupil widens at night, many myopes first discover their condition when trying to read road signs at night.</p>

  <h2 id="blur">The Myopic Image Shell</h2>
  
  <p>to do </p>

  <h2 id="the-far-point">The Far Point of a Myope</h2>

  <p>When a myopic eye views a distant object, parallel light enters the eye and the vergence leaving the back of the lens is too high to form an image on the retina. A clear image can only be formed when the vergence leaving the back of the lens is reduced. This can happen if divergent (rather than parallel) light is sent into the myopic eye, and divergent light naturally comes from closer objects.</p>

  <figure id="Figure2">
    <img src="media/image2.svg" />

    <figcaption>
      <span class="figno">Figure 2.</span> The myopic eye on the left cannot focus parallel rays from a distant object because it has too much power. However, if the object is placed close enough, the divergent light from the object cancels out the extra power in the myopic eye, allowing the light to be focussed on the retina. The point where this occurs is called the far point.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The divergence of the light from the nearby object (\(-5\text{D}\)) has precisely cancelled the extra power of the cornea (in the sense that the corneal power is \(60\text{D}\), but only \(55\text{D}\) is needed). When this happens, we say that the object has been placed at the <em>far point</em> of the myopic eye. The far point of a myopic eye is the furthest distance you can place an object and still see it clearly.</p>

  <p>The vergence of light from the far point, <em>when it hits the eye</em>, is called the <strong>ocular refraction</strong>. For example, if a patient has a far point of \(-0.2\text{m}\), their ocular refraction is \(1/(-0.2)=-5\text{D}\).</p>

  <h2 id="correcting-myopia-with-spectacles.">Correcting Myopia with Spectacles.</h2>

  <p>The myopic eye needs divergent light (equal to their ocular refraction) in order to see clearly. But light from distant objects is parallel, not divergent, so can’t be seen clearly by a myope. However, a myope <em>will</em> be able to see distant objects clearly if we change the vergence of the light to match their ocular refraction when it hits the eye. This can be done with spectacles: that is, a negative lens placed in front of the myopic eye.</p>

  <figure id="Figure3">
    <img src="media/image3.svg" />

    <figcaption>
      <span class="figno">Figure 3.</span> The principle behind spectacle correction for myopia. In the top image, an object is placed at the far point and the divergent light forms a sharp image on the bottom. In the bottom image, parallel light strikes a negative lens and diverges. The light appears to diverge from the image focal point. If the image focal point is in the same place as the far point, the spectacles have corrected the distance vision of the myope. When this happens, the sum of spectacle distance and spectacle focal length equals the far point distance.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Understanding spectacle correction depends on noticing two things:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>A myopic eye will see clearly when the light hitting it diverges - <em>or seems to diverge</em> - from the far point.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>When light from a distant object (vergence = 0) strikes a negative lens, the light leaving the lens will <em>seem</em> to diverge from the lens’s focal point (Chapter 2).</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Suppose then we carefully place a negative lens in front of a myopic eye so that the focal point of the lens is at the exactly the same place as the far point of that eye. When light from a distant object passes through the lens, it <em>seems</em> to diverge from the focal point of the lens. But the focal point is in the same place as the far point. So the light also <em>seems</em> to diverge from the far point of the eye. Light diverging from the far point can be seen clearly by the myope. The myope can now see distant objects clearly, by viewing them through the negative lens (<a href='#Figure3'>Figure 3</a>).</p>

  <p>Requiring that the focal point of the negative lens be placed exactly on top of the far point of the myopic eye leads to a simple mathematical relationship between the focal length of the spectacles, the far point distance, and the distance from spectacles to the eye. It is this:</p>

  <div>
    \[\text{(distance to far point)}=\text{(spectacle focal length)}-\text{(spectacle distance)}\]
  </div>

  <p>The minus sign in front of the spectacle distance is just because it is measured from the spectacles to the right in <a href='#Figure3'>Figure 3</a>, and so has a positive sign. The other distances are negative.</p>

  <h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>

  <p>A patient has an ocular refraction of \(-3.5\text{D}\), and the spectacle distance is \(15\text{mm}\). What should the power of the spectacles be?</p>

  <h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The distance to the far point is \(1/(-3.5)=-0.286\text{m}\). From the above equation relating far point to spectacle power we have</p>

      <div>
        \[-0.286 = f_{img}-0.015\]
      </div>

      <p>from which \(f_{img}=-0.286 + 0.015 = -0.271\text{m}\), so the spectacle power is \(1/(-0.271) = -3.69\text{D}\). Note that the spectacle power is <em>greater</em> than the ocular refraction. This always happens when correcting myopia with spectacles.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>While the sign convention can be quite useful in some contexts, here it is annoying. The same calculations can be done more easily if you think of all the distances as positive, and then put in the appropriate signs at the end. When doing this, you may need a diagram to keep things straight. Here’s how you could redo Example 1 <em>without</em> the sign convention:</p>

  <h3 id="example-1-ignoring-sign">Example 1, ignoring sign</h3>

  <p>A patient has an ocular refraction of \(-3.5\text{D}\), and the spectacle distance is 15mm. What should the power of the spectacles be?</p>

  <h4 id="answer-1">Answer</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Here is the diagram for this problem:</p>

      <figure>
        <img src='media/diagram1.png' />
      </figure>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The far point is \(1/(3.5)=0.286\text{m}\) in front of the patient’s eye. The spectacles are 0.015m in front of the patient’s eye, so the distance from spectacles to the far point (? in the diagram) is \(0.286-0.015 = 0.271\text{m}\). That must be the focal length of the spectacles, so the spectacle power is \(1/0.271 = 3.69\text{D}\). However, it&#39;s a negative lens, so we put in a minus sign to give \(-3.69\text{D}\).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="example-2-ignoring-sign">Example 2, ignoring sign</h3>

  <p>A patient has a pair of spectacles with power of \(-6\text{D}\), worn at a distance of \(15mm\). The patient wants to switch to contact lenses. What power should the contacts be?</p>

  <h4 id="answer-2">Answer</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Here is the diagram for this problem:</p>

      <figure>
        <img src='media/diagram2.png' />
      </figure>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>First we need to consider the existing prescription. The focal length of the existing spectacles is \(f_{img}=1/-6 =-0.167m\). The spectacle distance is \(0.015m\), so the total distance to the far point (? in the diagram) is</p>

      <div>
        \[\text{(distance to far point)}=0.0167+0.015 = 0.0182\text{m}\]
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Next consider what happens when we use contacts. The far point distance \(-0.182\text{m}\) doesn’t change, since the eye hasn’t changed. However, the spectacle distance is now zero, because the contacts rest on top of the cornea. So the spectacle equation says</p>

      <div>
        \[-0.182=\text{(spectacle focal length)}-0\]
      </div>

      <p>Thus the focal length of the contact lens (the “spectacles” in this case) must be \(-0.182m\), and the power of the contact lens is then \(1/-0.182 = -5.49\text{D}\). This contact lens has half a dioptre less power than the spectacles. That’s a noticeable difference, so if you ignored the effect of spectacle distance, you’d have one very annoyed customer.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="effectivity">Effectivity</h2>

  <p>The spectacle equation relates the focal length of the spectacles to the far point distance and the spectacle distance. Because spectacles are prescribed in terms of power rather than focal length, a variant of this the spectacle equation involving powers, called effectivity, has been developed. If we write the ocular refraction as \(K\), the far point distance is just \(1/K\) . If we write \(F\) for the spectacle power, then \(f_{img}=1/F\). Thus the spectacle equation becomes</p>

  <div>
    \[\frac{1}{K}=\frac{1}{F}-d\]
  </div>

  <p>A bit of algebra gives us</p>

  <div>
    \[F=\frac{K}{1-dK}\]
  </div>

  <p>This gives you the required spectacle power \(F\) as a function of ocular refraction \(K\) and spectacle distance. Personally, I can’t see the point of this equation, since it’s no easier to use than the spectacle equation, harder to remember, and obscures the simple relationship between the spectacle focal length and the far point distance.</p>

<h2 id='myopia'>Accommodation and Myopia</h2>

  <p>In the previous chapter, we defined the near point is the closest distance that an object can be seen clearly. When looking at an object placed at the near point, the eye is fully accommodated, and at its maximum power. The amplitude of accommodation for a myope is the <em>difference</em> in the vergence of light from the far point and the vergence at the near point:</p>

  <div>
    \[\left\{\begin{matrix} \text{amplitude of} \\ \text{accommodation}\end{matrix}\right\} = \left\{\begin{matrix} \text{vergence from} \\ \text{far point}\end{matrix}\right\} -\left\{\begin{matrix} \text{vergence from} \\ \text{near point}\end{matrix}\right\}\]
  </div>

  <p>For example, a myope who has a far point of 30cm and a near point of 10cm has an amplitude of accommodation equal to</p>

  <div>
    \[\frac{1}{-0.3}-\frac{1}{-0.1}=6.67\text{D}\]
  </div>

  <p>This definition of accommodative amplitude also works for an emmetrope. The emmetrope's far point is at infinity, so the vergence from the far point is zero.  Thus, an emmetrope who has a near point of 15cm and a far point at \(\infty\) has an amplitude of accommodation equal to</p>

  <div>
    \[0-\frac{1}{-0.15}=6.67\text{D}\]
  </div>

  <p>also.</p>

  <p>When a myope puts on spectacles, their far and near point change. To distinguish these new points, we say that the <strong>artificial</strong> far point is the far point when wearing spectacles, and the <strong>artificial</strong> near point is the near point when wearing spectacles. If we’ve done everything correctly, the artificial far point of a myope should be infinity, just like an emmetrope. There is no simple formula for the artificial near point, although you can work it out using the thin lens equation.</p>

  <p>One interesting feature of spectacle correction is that if we take an emmetrope and a myope with the same amplitudes of accommodation, and then correct the myope, the myope’s artificial near point is closer than the emmetrope’s near point. This effect depends on the spectacle distance and the amount of myopia; a zero spectacle distance (i.e. contact lenses) produces no improvement in the near point. This effect means that a myope wearing spectacles needs to accommodate less than an emmetrope who has the same amplitude of accommodation.</p>
 
<h3 id="near-add">Near Add</h3>

  <p>Reading glasses are designed for emmetropes. But what if you have myopia as well as presbyopia? Then, your reading glasses are created by a change in your prescription. The concept is simply that the spectacles myope wears will correct their distance vision, so an myope+spectacles is the same as an emmetrope. We could then put another pair of spectacles on them - the reading glasses - to let them see clearly close up.</p>

  <p>This would be silly in practice, so instead we add the power of their distance prescription and the reading glasses together to form a single lens. For example, if a patient had a reading (or working) distance of \(40\text{cm}\), then the (emmetropic) reading glasses would have a power of \(+2.5\text{D}\). If that patient was myopic, and their spectacle power was \(-3.5\text{D}\), then putting together their distance prescription \(-3.5\text{D}\) and their reading glasses of \(2.5\text{D}\), yields a total power of \(-1\text{D}\). That would then be the required power of their reading glasses - still negative, but not as much as their distance prescription.</p>

  <p>In this case, the power of the reading glasses (\(+2.5\text{D}\) in the example) is called the <em>near add</em>. It is the power added on top of the distance prescription to allow the patient to see near objects.</p>

  <p>Finally, we should note that if a patient is myopic, they may prefer to simply remove their spectacles for near work rather than use reading glasses. This is because removing the negative lens (which is what the myope wears) is the same as adding a positive lens, which is what the near add does.</p>

  <h2 id="multifocal-lenses">Multifocal lenses</h2>

  <p>Swapping between distance and reading glasses can be quite inconvenient, and many patients prefer to have both distance and reading/near prescriptions built into the same set of spectacles. These spectacles have lenses with at least two powers. A lens with exactly two powers is a bifocal lens, and one with many powers is a varifocal lens. We won’t go into the subtleties of the design of these lenses, but will just cover them briefly.</p>

  <h3 id="bifocals">Bifocals</h3>

  <p>A bifocal lens is a lens with two distinct optical powers, and can be thought of as two lenses which have been cut to fit one another, although they are not manufactured that way. Most of the bifocal lens has the distance prescription power, and a smaller (often D-shaped) segment has the distance power plus the near add. A D-segment bifocal lens is shown in Figure <a href="#bifocal" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="bifocal">[bifocal]</a>. Note that the D segment is displaced towards the nose. This is because the eyes will converge when looking at near objects.</p>

  <figure>
    <embed src="media/bifocals.svg" />

    <figcaption>
      D-segment bifocal lens. This lens would be placed in front of the patient’s right eye, because the D segment (containing the near add prescription) is displaced towards the nose.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3 id="varifocals.">Varifocals.</h3>

  <p>A varifocal lens is one where the power changes progressively from the distance power at the top of the lens to the distance power plus near add at the bottom of the lens. This kind of lens solves the problem shown in Figures 2 and 3 where there is a zone of distances that are not clear either with distance or near prescriptions. Because the varifocal power varies continuously, one can always find a part of the lens with exactly the right power to see an object at any distance.</p>

  <p>However, the lens shape that produces this continuous change in power from top to bottom also introduces zones of astigmatism at the sides of the lens. This is diagrammed in Figure <a href="#varifocals" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="varifocals">[varifocals]</a>. Often, the area of the lens free from astigmatism is quite small, and this can be annoying to patients.</p>

  <figure>
    <embed src="media/varifocals.svg" />

    <figcaption>
      Varifocal lens. This lens has a zone at the top set to the patient’s distance prescription, and a zone at the bottom set to their near prescription (= distance prescription plus near add). These zones are joined by a “corridor” where the power changes smoothly. Outside this corridor, the smooth change in power, together with the requirement that the lens surface is smooth, produces areas of astigmatism.
