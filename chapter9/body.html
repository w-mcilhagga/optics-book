  <h1 id="myopia">Myopia</h1>
  
  <p>Normally, the eye forms sharp images of distant objects on the retina without accommodation. This normal state of affairs is called <em>emmetropia</em> (meaning well-proportioned sight). Optically, this means that when parallel light hits the cornea, the convergence of the light leaving the back of the lens is exactly one over the distance from the lens to the retina, so that it converges to a point precisely on the retina.</p>
  
  <p>Not all eyes are normal, however. In European countries, about 20-30% of people cannot see distant objects clearly, but they can see closer objects without accommodating. These people have <em>myopia</em>, meaning short-sightedness. Optically, myopia occurs because the sharp image of a distant object forms slightly in front of the retina. By the time the light hits the retina, it has spread out somewhat, and so the image formed on the retina is blurred.</p>
  
  <p>A sharp image forms in front of the retina if the convergence of the light leaving the back surface of the lens is too high. One way this can happen is if some component of the eye's optics has too much power. For example, the cornea may be slightly more curved than normal (<a href='#Figure1'>Figure 1</a>), and this then converges the light too much. This kind of myopia is called <em>refractive</em> myopia.</p>

  <p>The other way an eye can be myopic is if it is too long (<a href='#Figure2'>Figure 2</a>), then the retina is further away from the lens than it should be. The light leaving the eye converges to where the retina <em>should</em> be, but the retina is actually a little further away. The eye's optics in this case are normal, but they are too powerful for a longer eye, which requires less power. This is called <em>axial</em> myopia, because the eye's optic axis is longer than it should be. This is the most common form of myopia. </p>

  <h2 id="the-far-point">The Far Point.</h2>

  <p>When a myopic eye views a distant object, parallel light enters the eye and the vergence leaving the back surface of the lens forms an image in front of the retina. To form an image <em>on</em> the retina, the vergence leaving the back surface of the lens needs to be reduced. This can happen if <em>divergent</em> (rather than parallel) light is sent into the myopic eye, and divergent light naturally comes from closer objects.</p>
  
  <p>Thus, if we bring an object close enough to the myopic eye, it will form a sharp image of that object on the retina (<a href='#Figure3'>Figure 3</a>). The point at which an object first becomes clear is called the <em>far point</em>. (The object will also be clear if it is moved even closer than the far point, but in that case the myopic eye is also accommodating.)</p>

  <figure id="Figure3">
    <div class='canvas-div' style='width:100%' id='figure3img'></div>
    <figcaption>
      <span class="figno">Figure 3.</span> Myopic eyes cannot see distant objects clearly, but they can see near objects, if they are close enough. Initially, an object is placed \(0.09\text{m}\) from this myopic eye. The image of the object still forms in front of the retina, so the image on the retina is blurred. However, by moving the object closer, the image can be made to land exactly on the retina. For the eye in the figure, this happens when the object is at about \(0.06\text{m}\) away.</p>
	  <p>The place where an object is seen clearly is called the far point.</p> 
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <script src='scripts/figure3.js'></script>

  <p>The vergence of light from the far point when it hits the cornea is called the <strong>ocular refraction</strong>. For example, if a patient has a far point of \(-0.2\text{m}\), their ocular refraction is \(1/(-0.2)=-5\text{D}\). The eye in <a href='#Figure3'>Figure 3</a> has a far point of \(-0.064\text{m}\), so the ocular refraction is about \(-15.6\text{D}\); this would be considered very high myopia.</p>

  <h2 id="correcting-myopia-with-spectacles.">Correcting Myopia with Spectacles.</h2>

  <p>The myopic eye needs divergent light (equal to their ocular refraction) in order to see clearly. But light from distant objects is parallel, not divergent, so can’t be seen clearly by a myope. However, a myope <em>will</em> be able to see distant objects clearly if we change the vergence of the light to match their ocular refraction when it hits the eye. This can be done with spectacles: that is, a negative lens placed in front of the myopic eye.</p>

  <p>Understanding spectacle correction depends on noticing two things:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>A myopic eye will see clearly when the light hitting it diverges - <em>or seems to diverge</em> - from the far point.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>When light from a distant object (vergence = 0) strikes a negative lens, the light leaving the lens will <em>seem</em> to diverge from the lens’s focal point (Chapter 2).</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Suppose then we carefully place a negative lens in front of a myopic eye so that the focal point of the lens is at the exactly the same place as the far point of that eye. When light from a distant object passes through the lens, it <em>seems</em> to diverge from the focal point of the lens. However, the focal point is in the same place as the far point. So the light leaving the negative lens also <em>seems</em> to diverge from the far point of the eye. Light diverging from the far point - or seeming to - can be seen clearly by the myope. (<a href='#Figure4'>Figure 4</a>).</p>

    <div class='canvas-div' style='width:100%' id='figure4img'></div>
    <figcaption>
      <span class="figno">Figure 4.</span> The principle behind spectacle correction. There are two eyes here, both of which have the same amount of myopia. In the top eye, a light placed at the far point (\(63-64\text{mm}\) from the front of the cornea) is focused on the retina (green dot).In the bottom image, parallel light (from a distant object) is focused in front of the retina (red dot).</p>
	  <p> By clicking the check box, you can insert a negative lens into the bottom image. The negative lens has a power of \(-20\text{D}\) so it forms a virtual image \(0.05\text{m}\) to its right (yellow lines). By moving the lens, you can move the point of focus within the eye. 
	  <ul><li>If the lens is too far from the eye, the light focuses in front of the retina.</li>
<li>If too close, the light focuses behind the retina.</li>
<li>At just the right distance, the light focuses <em>on</em> the retina.</li></ul> </p> 
	  <p>At the right distance, the virtual image created by the spectacle lens is <em>exactly</em> at the far point of the eye. The distance to the virtual image is the sum of the distance from the cornea to the lens and the lens to the focal point (there is a few mm of play in this). This equals the far point distance.</p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <script src='scripts/figure4_2.js'></script>
  
  <p>Requiring that the focal point of the negative lens be placed exactly on top of the far point of the myopic eye leads to a simple relationship between the focal length of the spectacles, the far point distance, and the distance from spectacles to the eye. It is this:</p>

  <div>
    \[\text{(distance to far point)}=\text{(spectacle focal length)}-\text{(spectacle distance)}\]
  </div>

  <p>The minus sign in front of the spectacle distance is just because it is measured from the spectacles to the right in <a href='#Figure4'>Figure 4</a>, and so has a positive sign. The other distances are negative.</p>

  <h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>

  <p>A patient has an ocular refraction of \(-3.5\text{D}\), and the spectacle distance is \(15\text{mm}\). What should the power of the spectacles be?</p>

  <h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The distance to the far point is \(1/(-3.5)=-0.286\text{m}\). From the above equation relating far point to spectacle power we have</p>

      <div>
        \[-0.286 = f_{img}-0.015\]
      </div>

      <p>from which \(f_{img}=-0.286 + 0.015 = -0.271\text{m}\), so the spectacle power is \(1/(-0.271) = -3.69\text{D}\). Note that the spectacle power is <em>greater</em> than the ocular refraction. This always happens when correcting myopia with spectacles.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>While the sign convention can be quite useful in some contexts, here it is annoying. The same calculations can be done more easily if you think of all the distances as positive, and then put in the appropriate signs at the end. When doing this, you may need a diagram to keep things straight. Here’s how you could redo Example 1 <em>without</em> the sign convention:</p>

  <h3 id="example-1-ignoring-sign">Example 1, ignoring sign</h3>

  <p>A patient has an ocular refraction of \(-3.5\text{D}\), and the spectacle distance is 15mm. What should the power of the spectacles be?</p>

  <h4 id="answer-1">Answer</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Here is the diagram for this problem:</p>

      <figure>
        <img src='media/diagram1.png' />
      </figure>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The far point is \(1/(3.5)=0.286\text{m}\) in front of the patient’s eye. The spectacles are 0.015m in front of the patient’s eye, so the distance from spectacles to the far point (? in the diagram) is \(0.286-0.015 = 0.271\text{m}\). That must be the focal length of the spectacles, so the spectacle power is \(1/0.271 = 3.69\text{D}\). However, it&#39;s a negative lens, so we put in a minus sign to give \(-3.69\text{D}\).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="example-2-ignoring-sign">Example 2, ignoring sign</h3>

  <p>A patient has a pair of spectacles with power of \(-6\text{D}\), worn at a distance of \(15mm\). The patient wants to switch to contact lenses. What power should the contacts be?</p>

  <h4 id="answer-2">Answer</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Here is the diagram for this problem:</p>

      <figure>
        <img src='media/diagram2.png' />
      </figure>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>First we need to consider the existing prescription. The focal length of the existing spectacles is \(f_{img}=1/-6 =-0.167m\). The spectacle distance is \(0.015m\), so the total distance to the far point (? in the diagram) is</p>

      <div>
        \[\text{(distance to far point)}=0.0167+0.015 = 0.0182\text{m}\]
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Next consider what happens when we use contacts. The far point distance \(-0.182\text{m}\) doesn’t change, since the eye hasn’t changed. However, the spectacle distance is now zero, because the contacts rest on top of the cornea. So the spectacle equation says</p>

      <div>
        \[-0.182=\text{(spectacle focal length)}-0\]
      </div>

      <p>Thus the focal length of the contact lens (the “spectacles” in this case) must be \(-0.182m\), and the power of the contact lens is then \(1/-0.182 = -5.49\text{D}\). This contact lens has half a dioptre less power than the spectacles. That’s a noticeable difference, so if you ignored the effect of spectacle distance, you’d have one very annoyed customer.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="effectivity">Effectivity</h2>

  <p>The spectacle equation above relates the focal length of the spectacles to the far point distance and the spectacle distance. Because spectacles are prescribed in terms of power rather than focal length, a variant of this the spectacle equation involving powers, called effectivity, can be used. If we write the ocular refraction as \(K\), the distance to the far point is just \(1/K\) . If we write \(F\) for the spectacle power, then the spectacle focal length is \(1/F\). Thus the spectacle equation </p>
  
  <div>
    \[\text{(distance to far point)}=\text{(spectacle focal length)}-\text{(spectacle distance)}\]
  </div>
  
  <p>becomes (writing \(d\) for the spectacle distance):</p>

  <div>
    \[\frac{1}{K}=\frac{1}{F}-d\]
  </div>

  <p>A bit of algebra gives us</p>

  <div>
    \[F=\frac{K}{1-dK}\]
  </div>

  <p>This gives you the required spectacle power \(F\) as a function of ocular refraction \(K\) and spectacle distance \(d\). Personally, I can’t see the point of this equation, since it’s no easier to use than the spectacle equation, harder to remember, and obscures the simple relationship between the spectacle focal length and the far point distance.</p>
  
<h2 id="blur">Myopic Blur</h2>

  <p>The main optical consequence of myopia is blur. If a sharp image of a distant object always forms in front of the retina of the myopic eye, by the time the light reaches the eye it has spread out again, and the image is no longer sharp. The amount of blur produced by myopia can be calculated using the blur equation introduced in Chapter 5</p>

  <div>
    \[\theta_{blur}=57 a |V_{need}-V_{out}|\]
  </div>

  <p>In this formula, the difference \(|V_{need}-V_{out}|\) is the mismatch between the power of the eye&#39;s optics \(V_{out}\) and the power needed to form a sharp image \(V_{need}\). In myopia, \(V_{out}&gt;V_{need}\). The aperture \(a\) in the formula is the pupil diameter, in metres. So the amount of blur experienced by a myope is directly proportional to the amount of myopia, and to the pupil size.</p>

  <p>This is exploited in the Snellen and Bailie-Lovie eye charts. By seeing what size of letter is blurred beyond recognition we can estimate the size of the blur circle \(\theta_{blur}\), and from that the amount of refractive error. Of course, to do this, we have to measure or control the pupil diameter \(a\), since that affects the amount of blur.</p>

  <p>Anther consequence of the blur equation is that blur worsens when the pupil diameter \(a\) increases. Since the pupil widens at night, many myopes first discover their condition when trying to read road signs at night.</p>

<h2 id='myopia'>Accommodation and Myopia</h2>

  <p>In the last chapter, we defined the near point of an emmetrope as the closest distance that an object can be seen clearly. Then, the amplitude of accommodation was just the vergence at the near point. The amplitude of accommodation for myopes is slighlty different.</p>
  
  <p>The near point of a myope is still the closest distance that an object can be seen clearly, but the vergence at that point isn't the amplitude of accommodation, because we have to take the myope's far point into account. </p>
  
  <p>When an object is placed at the far point, the eye is relaxed, and there is no accommodation. When looking at an object placed at the near point, the eye is fully accommodated, and at its maximum power. The amplitude of accommodation is the <em>difference</em> in the vergence of light from the far point and the vergence at the near point:</p>

  <div>
    \[\left\{\begin{matrix} \text{amplitude of} \\ \text{accommodation}\end{matrix}\right\} = \left\{\begin{matrix} \text{vergence from} \\ \text{far point}\end{matrix}\right\} -\left\{\begin{matrix} \text{vergence from} \\ \text{near point}\end{matrix}\right\}\]
  </div>

  <p>For example, a myope who has a far point of 30cm and a near point of 10cm has an amplitude of accommodation equal to</p>

  <div>
    \[\frac{1}{-0.3}-\frac{1}{-0.1}=6.67\text{D}\]
  </div>

  <p>As it happens, this definition also works for an emmetrope. The emmetrope's far point is at infinity, so the vergence from the far point is zero.  Thus, an emmetrope who has a near point of 15cm and a far point at \(\infty\) has an amplitude of accommodation equal to</p>

  <div>
    \[0-\frac{1}{-0.15}=6.67\text{D}\]
  </div>

  <p>also.</p>

  <p>When a myope puts on spectacles, their far and near point change. To distinguish these new points, we say that the <strong>artificial</strong> far point and the <strong>artificial</strong> near point are the far point and near point when wearing spectacles. If we’ve done everything correctly, the artificial far point of a myope should be infinity, just like an emmetrope. There is no simple formula for the artificial near point, although you can work it out using the thin lens equation.</p>

  <p>One interesting feature of spectacle correction is that if we take an emmetrope and a myope with the same amplitudes of accommodation, and then correct the myope, the myope’s artificial near point is closer than the emmetrope’s near point. This effect depends on the spectacle distance and the amount of myopia; a zero spectacle distance (i.e. contact lenses) produces no improvement in the near point. This effect means that a myope wearing spectacles needs to accommodate slightly less than an emmetrope who has the same amplitude of accommodation.</p>
 
<h3 id="near-add">Near Add</h3>

  <p>Reading glasses are designed for emmetropes. But what if you have myopia as well as presbyopia? Then, your reading glasses are created by a change in your prescription. The concept is simply that the spectacles myope wears will correct their distance vision, so an myope with spectacles is the same as an emmetrope. We could then put another pair of spectacles on them - the reading glasses - to let them see clearly close up.</p>

  <p>This would be silly in practice, so instead we add the power of their distance prescription and the reading glasses together to form a single lens. For example, if a patient had a reading (or working) distance of \(40\text{cm}\), then if they were an emmetrope their reading glasses would have a power of \(+2.5\text{D}\). If that patient was myopic, and their spectacle power was \(-3.5\text{D}\), then putting together their distance prescription \(-3.5\text{D}\) and their reading glasses of \(2.5\text{D}\), yields a total power of \(-1\text{D}\). That would then be the required power of their reading glasses - still negative, but not as much as their distance prescription.</p>

  <p>In this case, the power of the reading glasses (\(+2.5\text{D}\) in the example) is called the <em>near add</em>. It is the power added on top of the distance prescription to allow the patient to see near objects.</p>

  <p>Finally, we should note that if a patient is myopic, they may prefer to simply remove their spectacles for near work rather than use reading glasses. This is because removing the negative lens (which is what the myope wears) is the same as adding a positive lens, which is what the near add does.</p>

  <h2 id="multifocal-lenses">Multifocal lenses</h2>

  <p>Swapping between distance and reading glasses can be quite inconvenient, and many patients prefer to have both distance and reading/near prescriptions built into the same set of spectacles. These spectacles have lenses with at least two powers. A lens with exactly two powers is a bifocal lens, and one with many powers is a varifocal lens. We won’t go into the subtleties of the design of these lenses, but will just cover them briefly.</p>

  <h3 id="bifocals">Bifocals</h3>

  <p>A bifocal lens is a lens with two distinct optical powers, and can be thought of as two lenses which have been cut to fit one another, although they are not manufactured that way. Most of the bifocal lens has the distance prescription power, and a smaller (often D-shaped) segment has the distance power plus the near add. A D-segment bifocal lens is shown in Figure <a href="#bifocal" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="bifocal">[bifocal]</a>. Note that the D segment is displaced towards the nose. This is because the eyes will converge when looking at near objects.</p>

  <figure>
    <embed src="media/bifocals.svg" />

    <figcaption>
      D-segment bifocal lens. This lens would be placed in front of the patient’s right eye, because the D segment (containing the near add prescription) is displaced towards the nose. Darker shades indicate more negative areas of the lens.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3 id="varifocals.">Varifocals.</h3>

  <p>A varifocal lens is one where the power changes progressively from the distance power at the top of the lens to the distance power plus near add at the bottom of the lens. This kind of lens solves the problem shown in Figures 2 and 3 where there is a zone of distances that are not clear either with distance or near prescriptions. Because the varifocal power varies continuously, one can always find a part of the lens with exactly the right power to see an object at any distance.</p>

  <p>However, the lens shape that produces this continuous change in power from top to bottom also introduces zones of astigmatism at the sides of the lens. This is diagrammed in Figure <a href="#varifocals" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="varifocals">[varifocals]</a>. Often, the area of the lens free from astigmatism is quite small, and this can be annoying to patients.</p>

  <figure>
    <embed src="media/varifocals.svg" />

    <figcaption>
      Varifocal lens. This lens has a zone at the top set to the patient’s distance prescription, and a zone at the bottom set to their near prescription (= distance prescription plus near add). These zones are joined by a “corridor” where the power changes smoothly. Darker shades indicate more negative areas of the lens. Outside this corridor, the smooth change in power, together with the requirement that the lens surface is smooth, produces areas of astigmatism (shaded in green).
