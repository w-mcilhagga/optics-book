  <h1>More Optical Matrices.</h1>
  
  <p>In Chapter 17, the basics of using matrices in optics were laid out, and the matrices for a gap, a thin lens, and a refracting surface were worked out. Here we will put these matrices to use in analyzing various systems.</p>
  
  <h2>A Lens and a Gap.</h2>
  
  <p>If we have a lens with power \(F\), and put an image screen at a distance of \(1/F\) away, we have a system which creates images of distant objects on the screen, as in Figure 1(a). What does this system look like when expressed as an optical matrix?</p>

<figure id="Figure1">
	<span class='slideshow-container'>

			<figcaption>
			  <span class="figno">Figure 1(a).</span> An optical system consists of a lens with power \(F\) followed by a gap of length \(1/F\). The lens is centred on the optic axis (dotted line). At the end of the gap there is an image screen to catch the light.

		<span>
			<img src="media/figure1b.svg" />

			<figcaption>
			  <span class="figno">Figure 1(b).</span> The matrix representing this system has a zero in the top left corner. That means the height \(h_2\) at the end of the system (where the image screen is) depends only on the slant \(s_1\) of rays entering the system (that is, hitting the lens). All rays with the same slope end up at the same height.

			  <span class="figno">Figure 1(c).</span> Another bunch of rays with the same slope end up at the same height, but it is a different height from the previous image because the ray slopes are different.

		</span>
	</span>
</figure>

  <p>There are two matrices involved. The first is the matrix for a lens of power \(F\), given in the first row of the table below. The second is for a gap of length \(1/F\), in the second row. There is no optical matrix for an image screen, because the light simply stops when it hits the screen.</p>
  
  <table class=mid>
  <tr>
	  <td>
		Matrix for a lens
	  </td>
	  <td>
		\[
		\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 \\
		-F & 1
		\end{bmatrix}
		\]
	  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td>
		Matrix for a gap of size \(1/F\)
	  </td>
	  <td>
		\[
		\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 1/F \\
		0 & 1
		\end{bmatrix}
		\]
	  </td>
  </tr>  
  </table>
  
  <p>The matrix description of this system is given by the following matrix equation:</p>
  
  <div>\[
  \bmatrix{h_2\\s_2} = \bmatrix{1 & 1/F\\0 & 1}\bmatrix{1&0\\-F&1}\bmatrix{h_1\\s_1}
  \]</div>
  
  <p>Note that the lens and gap matrices are written in order from right-to-left. This equation can be simplified by multiplying the two matrices together to get a single matrix for the whole system:
  
  <div>\[
  \bmatrix{1 & 1/F\\0 & 1}\bmatrix{1&0\\-F&1} = \bmatrix{0&1/F\\-F&1}
  \]</div>
  
  <p>Thus the lens followed by gap system can be described by a single matrix:</p>
  
  <div>
  \[
  \bmatrix{h_2\\s_2} = \bmatrix{0&1/F\\-F&1}\bmatrix{h_1\\s_1}
  \]
  </div>
  
  <p>The single matrix for the whole system has a zero in the top left corner. That means that the height \(h_2\) of the ray at the end of the system depends only on the slope \(s_1\) of the ray at the start:</p>
  
  <div>\[
  h_2 = (1/F)s_1
  \]</div>
  
  <p>What this equation says is that all rays with the same slope at the start of this optical system \(s_1\), regardless of height \(h_1\), end up having the same height \(h_2\) at the end of the system. This is shown in Figure 1(b) and Figure 1(c). A set of rays which all have the same slope \(s_1\) is a bundle of parallel rays (with a vergence of zero). They all end up at the same point, with height \(h_2\), at the end of the system.</p>
  
  <p>We can conclude</p>
  
  <p class='rule'>Any optical matrix with a zero in the top left corner is describing a system where parallel rays of light are converged to the same point, forming an image.</p>
  
  <p>What about the slopes? From the matrix equation above, we can see that</p>
  
  <div>\[
  s_2 = -F h_1 + s_1
  \]</div>
  
  <p>When \(h_1=0\), the ray is striking the centre of the lens, and in that case \(s_2=s_1\). We've come across this before, as the Third Rule of ray-tracing.
  
  <h3>A Refracting Surface and a Gap</h3>
  
  <p>A slightly more complicated case occurs when we have a refracting surface with power \(F_{surface}\) followed by a gap of length \(n_{out}/F_{surface}\), which is the focal length of the surface. The matrices for the surface (assuming \(n_{in}=1\)) and the gap are given in the table below:</p>
  
  <table class=mid>
  <tr>
	  <td>
		Matrix for a surface
	  </td>
	  <td>
		\[
		\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 \\
		-F_{surface}/n_{out} & 1/n_{out}
		\end{bmatrix}
		\]
	  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td>
		Matrix for a gap of size \(n_{out}/F_{surface}\)
	  </td>
	  <td>
		\[
		\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & n_{out}/F_{surface} \\
		0 & 1
		\end{bmatrix}
		\]
	  </td>
  </tr>  
  </table>
  
  <p>Multiplying these two matrices together gives the matrix for the whole system:</p>
  
  <div>
  \[
	\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & n_{out}/F_{surface} \\
	0 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\
	-F_{surface}/n_{out} & 1/n_{out}
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 1/F_{surface} \\
	-F_{surface}/n_{out} & 1/n_{out}
	\end{bmatrix}
  \]
  </div>
  
  <p>Again, there is a zero in the top left corner of the matrix, because this system focuses parallel light to form an image. However, if we look at the slopes from this matrix, we can see that</p>
  
  <div>\[
  s_2 = \frac{-F_{surface}}{n_{out}} h_1 + \frac{1}{n_{out}}s_1
  \]</div>
  
  When \(h_1=0\), the slope is \(s_2 = s_1/n_{out}\); so in this case Rule 3 of ray-tracing doesn't work.
  
  <h2>A Gap and a Lens</h2>
  
  <p>A system consisting of a gap of length \(1/F\) followed by a lens of power \(F\) is shown in Figure 2(a). This is similar to the lens and gap system discussed above, except that the order of the matrices is reversed, as follows:</p>

  <div>\[
  \bmatrix{h_2\\s_2} = \bmatrix{1&0\\-F&1}\bmatrix{1 & 1/F\\0 & 1}\bmatrix{h_1\\s_1}
  \]</div>

<figure id="Figure2">
	<span class='slideshow-container'>
		<span>
			<img src="media/figure2a.svg" />

			<figcaption>
			  <span class="figno">Figure 2(a).</span> An optical system consists of a gap of length \(1/F\) followed by a lens with power \(F\). The reference plane at the start of the system is shown by the dotted vertical line. The lens is centred on the optic axis (dotted line). 
			</figcaption>
		
		</span>
		<span>
			<img src="media/figure2b.svg" />

			<figcaption>
			  <span class="figno">Figure 2(b).</span> The matrix representing this system has a zero in the bottom right corner. That means the slope \(s_2\) at the end of the system (where the light leaves the lens) depends only on the height \(h_1\) of rays at the start of the system (that is, where the reference plane is). All rays starting with the same height end up with the same slope - that is, parallel.
			</figcaption>
		
		</span>
		<span>
			<img src="media/figure2c.svg" />

			<figcaption>
			  <span class="figno">Figure 2(c).</span> Another bunch of rays starting with the same height end up with the same slope, but it is a different slope from the previous image because the ray heights are different.
			</figcaption>
		
		</span>
	</span>
</figure>  

  <p>This equation can be simplified by multiplying the two matrices together to get a single matrix for the whole system. The result is:</p>
  
  <div>
  \[
  \bmatrix{h_2\\s_2} = \bmatrix{1& 1/F\\-F& 0}\bmatrix{h_1\\s_1}
  \]
  </div>

  
  <p>This matrix has a zero in bottom right corner. That means the slope \(s_2\) of the ray leaving the system depends only on the height \(h_1\) of the ray at the start:</p>
  
  <div>\[
  s_2 = -F h_1
  \]</div>
  
  That is, all rays with the same height \(h_1\), no matter what slope they have, end up with the same slope \(s_2\). A bundle of rays with the same slope is a bundle of parallel rays, so this matrix tells us that all rays from a single point emerege from the system in parallel. This is shown in Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c). </p>
  
    <p>We can conclude</p>
  
  <p class='rule'>Any optical matrix with a zero in the bottom right corner is describing a system where all light rays from a single point at the start of the system emerge in parallel.</p>
  
  <h3>Inverses and Reverses</h3>
  
  <p>The matrix for a lens of power \(F\) followed by a gap of length \(1/F\) is</p>
  
    <div>
  \[
  \bmatrix{0&1/F\\-F&1}
  \]
  </div>
  
  <p>The matrix for a gap of length \(1/F\) followed by a lens with power \(F\) is </p>
  
  <div>
  \[
  \bmatrix{1& 1/F\\-F& 0}
  \]
  </div>

  <p>The second matrix isn't quite the <em>inverse</em> of the first. Instead, it is the <em>reverse</em>, given by:</p>
  
  <div>
  \[
  reverse\left(\bmatrix{A&B\\C&D}\right) = \dfrac{1}{AD-BC}\bmatrix{D&B\\C&A}
  \]
  </div>
  
  <p>The reverse of a matrix is an optical system where all the parts are in the reversed order.</p>

  <h2>A Telescope</h2>
  
  <p>A telescope consists of an objective lens with power \(F_o\), a gap, and an eyepiece with power \(F_e\). The gap is the sum of the focal lengths \(1/F_o+1/F_e\) of the objective and eyepiece (Figure 3(a)). The matrices for these three parts are given in the table below.</p>
  
  <table class=mid>
  <tr>
	  <td>
		Matrix for objective
	  </td>
	  <td>
		\[
		\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 \\
		-F_o & 1
		\end{bmatrix}
		\]
	  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td>
		Matrix for a gap of size \(1/F_o+1/F_e\)
	  </td>
	  <td>
		\[
		\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 1/F_o+1/F_e \\
		0 & 1
		\end{bmatrix}
		\]
	  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td>
		Matrix for eyepiece
	  </td>
	  <td>
		\[
		\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 \\
		-F_e & 1
		\end{bmatrix}
		\]
	  </td>
  </tr>  
  </table>

  <p>The matrix equation for the telescope is thus</p>
  
  <div>\[
  \bmatrix{h_2 \\ s_2} = \bmatrix{1 & 0 \\-F_e & 1}\bmatrix{1 & 1/F_o+1/F_e \\0 & 1}\bmatrix{1 & 0 \\-F_o & 1}
  \bmatrix{h_1 \\ s_1}
  \]</div>
  
  <p>Note that, as usual, the matrices are written from right to left in the order that the light ray hits them. We can reduce this to a simpler matrix equation by multiplying together the three matrices to get a single matrix:</p>
  
  <div>
  \[
	\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\
	-F_e & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 1/F_o+1/F_e \\
	0 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\
	-F_o & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
	-F_o/F_e & 1/F_o+1/F_e \\
	0 & -F_e/F_o
	\end{bmatrix}
  \]
  </div>
  
  <p>Then the matrix equation for a telescope looks like this:</p>
  
  <div>\[
  \bmatrix{h_2 \\ s_2} = \bmatrix{-F_o/F_e & 1/F_o+1/F_e \\0 & -F_e/F_o}\bmatrix{h_1 \\ s_1}
  \]</div>
  
  <p>If you recall, the magnification of the telescope is \(M=-F_e/F_o\), so the matrix equation really looks like this:</p>

  <div>\[
  \bmatrix{h_2 \\ s_2} = \bmatrix{1/M & \text{(length of scope)} \\0 & M}\bmatrix{h_1 \\ s_1}
  \]</div>
  
  <p>Notice that this matrix has a zero in the lower left corner. That means that the slope \(s_2\) at the end of the system depends only on the slope \(s_1\) at the start, and not on the height \(h_1\). That is:</p>
  
  <div>\[
  s_2 = M s_1
  \]</div>
  
  <p>What this equation is saying is that a bundle or parallel rays (all with the same slope) come out of the telescope parallel, but with a different slope. This is shown in Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c).</p>
  
  <figure id="Figure3">
	<span class='slideshow-container'>
		<span>
			<img src="media/figure3a.svg" />

			<figcaption>
			  <span class="figno">Figure 3(a).</span> A telescope consists of an objective lens and an eyepiece separated by a gap. The gap is the sum of the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece. Here, the eyepiece is a positive lens, so it is an astronomical telescope.

		<span>
			<img src="media/figure3b.svg" />

			<figcaption>
			  <span class="figno">Figure 3(b).</span> A bundle of rays enters the telescope with the same slope \(s_1\). Since they all have the same slope, the rays are parallel. The slope at the end of the telescope \(s_2\) is just \(M s_1\), so the rays all leave the telescope with the same slope, juts \(M\) times bigger than the slope at the start. An astronomical telescope has a negative magnification. The rays enetring the telescope have a positive slope (going upwards) but leave with a negative slope (going downwards).
			</figcaption>
		
		</span>
		<span>
			<img src="media/figure3c.svg" />

			<figcaption>
			  <span class="figno">Figure 3(c).</span> Another bundle of parallel rays with the same slope enters the telescope. They leave with the same slope, but it is again \(M\) times larger than the slope on entry.
			</figcaption>
		
		</span>
	</span>
</figure>  

  <p>We can conclude</p>
  
  <p class='rule'>Any optical matrix with a zero in the bottom left corner is describing a system where angular magnification takes place (like a telescope).</p>
  
  <h2>A Model Eye</h2>
  
  <p>Every optical system can be boiled down to a single matrix with four numbers. We have so far done this with relatively simple optical systems, but now we will use matrix methods to analyze a very complicated optical system: the LeGrand Model eye (introduced in Chapter 8). The LeGrand Model eye is a simplified version of the human eye, useful for optical calculations. It consists of a (very long) series of surfaces and gaps. These surfaces and gaps, written as matrices, are given in the table below (to a large number of decimal places).</p>

  <table class=mid>

  </td>

  </tr>

  </table>
  
<p>The matrix describing the entire eye can be obtained by multiplying all these matrices together in the right order. Obviously you wouldn't want to do this by hand, but luckily there are computer programs that can multiply matrices for us (for example <a href="https://www.symbolab.com/solver/matrix-calculator" target=blank>here</a> or <a href="https://www.desmos.com/matrix" target=blank>here</a>). If we use a computer program to multiply all of these matrices together, we get:</p>

<div>
\[
\text{Le Grand} = \bmatrix{0 & 0.01668\\ 44.86559 & 0.67696 }
\]
</div>

<p>This is a remarkably simple equation, given how many optical components went into it. The matrix for the LeGrand eye has a zero in the upper left corner, so it focuses parallel light to a single point, like a lens followed by a gap, or a surface followed by a gap.</p>

<p>One of the most useful things about this equation is it makes it very easy to work out the size of the retinal image from the slant of the rays hitting the eye. The zero in the upper left means that the height \(h_2\) of the ray at the end (i.e. on the retina, because that's where the system ends) depends only on the slant of the ray \(s_1\) when it enters the eye</p>

<div>\[
	h_2 = 0.01668 s_1
\]</div>

<p>For example, if a ray (or bundle of rays) enters the eye with a slope of \(s_1=0.0875\) (which is an angle of 5 degrees), this equation says that the height on the retina (above or below the centre of the retina) is 
\(h_2 = 0.0875x0.01668 = 0.00146\text{m}\), or about \(1.5\)mm. From that, we can say that a visual angle of \(1\) degree gives an image height of \(0.3\)mm. </p>

  <h2>A Magnifying Lens and an Eye</h2>
  
<p>We can use the LeGrand eye matrix to work out the size of an image formed by a magnifier. Suppose we hold a magnifying glass of power \(F\) at \(1/F\) from the thing we want to magnify, and we have a gap of length \(d\) between the magnifier and the eye. We'll use the LeGrand matrix to represent the eye. The matrices involved are:
</p>
  
<table class=mid>
<tr>
<td>Gap of length \(1/F\) and lens with power \(F\)</td>
<td>
\[
\bmatrix{1 & 1/F \\ -F & 0}
\]
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Gap of length d</td>
<td>
\[
\bmatrix{1 & d \\ 0 & 1}
\]
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LeGrand eye</td>
<td>
\[
\bmatrix{0&0.01668\\ 44.86559&0.67696 }
\]
</td>
</tr>


</table>

<p>If we multiply these together in the right order, we get:</p>

<div>\[
\bmatrix{0&0.01668\\ 44.86559&0.67696 }\bmatrix{1 & d \\ 0 & 1}\bmatrix{1 & 1/F \\ -F & 0} =
\bmatrix{-0.01668F & 0 \\ -44.86559(1-d F)-0.67696 F & -44.86559/F}
\]</div>

<p>and so, the equation for a ray \(\bmatrix{h_1\\s_1}\) which starts on the object being magnified, goes through the magnifier, across the gap, and into the eye, ending up on the eye's retina, is:</p>

<div>\[
\bmatrix{h_2\\s_2} =
\bmatrix{-0.01668F & 0 \\ -44.86559(1-d F)-0.67696 F & -44.86559/F}\bmatrix{h_1\\s_1}
\]</div>

<p>This is the most complex matrix equation we have come across so far, but the interesting thing is the zero in the top right corner of the matrix. This says that the height of the ray at the end of the system (which is the height of the ray on the retina) only depends on the height of the ray at the start (which is the height of the object) according to the equation</p>

<div>\[
h_2 = -0.01668F\; h_1
\]</div>

<p>
The gap \(d\) doesn't come into this at all, so the size of the magnified image on the retina doesn't depend on the gap.
</p>

  <h2>Ophthalmoscopy</h2>
  
  <p>We'll finish our tour of some interesting optical systems by analyzing direct ophthalmoscopy. The simplest way of thinking about this is to imagine a ray starting from the patient's retina, coming out of their eye, crossing a gap of width \(d\) between the patient and practitioner, and then entering the practioner's eye and ending up on their retina. The matrix for the gap is just the standard one for a gap, and we can use the LeGrand eye matrix to describe the practitioner. But what about the patient? The LeGrand eye matrix above is for a ray entering the eye and ending on the retina, but in ophthalmoscopy, the ray starts on the retuna and exits the eye. That is, it follows the reverse path. So the patient's eye should be the reverse of the LeGrand eye, namely</p>
  
  <div>\[
  \text{patient eye} = reverse\left( \bmatrix{0 & 0.01668\\ 44.86559 & 0.67696 } \right) = \bmatrix{0.90442 & 0.022289\\-59.9404 & 0}
  \]</div>
  
  <p>Thus the matrices involved in analyzing direct ophthalmoscopy are:</p>
  
  <table class=mid>
  <tr>
  <td>Reversed eye</td>
  <td>
  \[\bmatrix{0.90442 & 0.022289\\-59.9404&0}\]
  </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>

  <p>and so the matrix equation describing direct ophthalmoscopy is</p>
  
  <div>
  \[
  \bmatrix{h_2\\s_2}=\bmatrix{-1 & 0 \\ 2689d-81.15 & -1}\bmatrix{h_1\\s_1}
  \]
  </div>  

  <p>The top row is really interesting here; it says</p>
  
  <div>\[h_2 = -h_1\]</div>
  
  <p>That is, the ray that starts at height \(h_1\) on the patient's retina ends up at height \(h_2=-h_1\) on the practitioner's retina. So if the ray starts above the centre of the patient's eye (positive \(h\)) it ends up below the centre of the practitioner's eye. Apart from the negative sign, though, the height is the same, and it doesn't depend on the slope of the ray or the distance between the two eyes.</p>
  
  
  <h2>Full Circle.</h2>
  
  <p>We started in Chapter 1 by defining the vergence of a bundle of rays, and how that vergence is changed by a lens. In the matrix approach, we don't usually care about vergences, since we are following individual rays as they pass through the system. But we can think of the matrix approach in terms of vergences, and we will do so here.</p>
  
  <p>Imaging a bundle of rays diverging from a point on the optic axis, as in Figure 4. If we put a reference plane a distance \(u\) from the rays, then the vergence of the rays hitting the plane is</p>
  
  <div>\[V = \frac{1}{-u}\]</div>
  
  <p>Looking at one ray with height \(h\), the slope of the ray is \(s=h/u\). Since \(V=1/(-u)\), the slope is then \(s = -h V\). Thus, the vergence of the ray is</p>
  
  <div>\[V = \frac{-s}{h}\]</div>
  
  <p>So we have two different ways of thinking about a ray</p>

  <p>Next, <em>any</em> optical system can be written as a 2-by-2 matrix \(\bmatrix{A & B \\ C & D}\), so if we think of a ray with vergence \(V_{in}\) hitting this system, the result is</p>
  
  <div>\[
  \bmatrix{h_2\\s_2} = \bmatrix{A & B \\ C & D}\bmatrix{h_1 \\-h_1 V_{in}}
  \]</div>
  
  <p>From this, we have two equations</p>
  
  <div>\[
  \begin{align}
  h_2 &= A h_1 -B h_1 V_{in} &=h_1(A-B V_{in})\\
  s_2 &= C h_1 -D h_1 V_{in} &=h_1(C-D V_{in})
  \end{align}
  \]</div>
  
  <p>The vergence \(V_{out}\) of the ray at the end of the system \(\bmatrix{h_2\\s_2}\) is \(V_{out}=-s_2/h_2\). Thus </p>
  
  <div>\[
  V_{out} = \frac{-s_2}{h_2} = \frac{-h_1(C-D V_{in})}{h_1(A-B V_{in})}=\frac{D V_{in}-C}{A - B V_{in}}
  \]</div>
  
  <p>That's certainly more complicated than the thin lens equation in Chapter 1, because this equation can deal with any optical system, not just a thin lens. But what if the optical system is simply a thin lens? In that case the matrix is</p>
  
  <div>\[
  \bmatrix{A & B \\ C & D} = \bmatrix{1 & 0 \\ -F & 1}
  \]</div>
  
  <p>That is, \(A\) and \(D\) are both \(1\), \(C\) is \(-F\), and \(B\) is zero. Then the above vertgence equation becomes
  
   <div>\[
  V_{out} = \frac{D V_{in}-C}{A - B V_{in}}=\frac{V_{in}-(-F)}{1 - 0} = V_{in}+F
  \]</div>
  
  <p>which is just the thin lens equation.</p>
